# Function first methodology
WET5 Function first methodoloy explores a faster, less envolved approach to the development of features and functionality. Its main difference from the Modular first approach is that the focus of the implementation is on a single(s) functions instead of modularize "gears" that pollenate the HTML.

## Benefits
This approach is focused for the following development differences;

* Faster development of new function(s) and/or feature(s)
* Decreased modularization
* Easier plug-in style arch.
* Less HTML data-attribute
* Increased data-option paramaters (creating a bit more complex parameter passing)

## Development Notes
### Rules
1. All `data-wb5` element scope
### Assumptions
There are a few assumptions in the function first approach that need to be taken into consideration
